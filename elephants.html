	   <h1>Facts about Elephants</h1>

	   <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7f/ee/30/7fee30824d3fa4a9a9e86bce831a4581.jpg" alt="twins" class="elle_twins" style="width:20%">
	   <p>Elephants have the longest <strong>pregnancy</strong> of all the animals. Thay can reproduce at the age of 16 and it takes a female <strong>22 months</strong> from conception to give birth. Newborn elephants can stand up shortly after the birth. They are born blind and expected to walk over 12 miles a day after they were born. Elephant females can have babies until they are about 50 years old. They tend to have a new baby every 2 and half to 4 years. They usually have one baby, twins are very rare. They can live to be over 70 years old.</p>

	   <p>Elephants are <strong>capable of human-like emotions</strong> such as feeling <em>loss, grieving, compassion, self-awareness, altruism and even crying</em>. They also play, have incredible memories and laugh. Elephants are highly sensitive and caring animals. If a baby elephant complains, the entire family will rumble and go over to touch and caress it. They remember and mourn their loved ones, even many years after their death. When the 'Elephant Whisperer' Lawrence Anthony died, a herd of elephants arrived at his house to mourn him. Elephants pay homage to the bones of their dead, gently touching the skulls and tusks with their trunks and feet. When an elephant walks past a place that a loved one has died, he/she will stop dead still; a silent and empty pause that can last several minutes. Like human toddlers, great apes, magpies and dolphins, elephants have passed the mirror test, <em>they recognize themselves in a mirror</em>.</p>

	   <p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTc7i397SjdXlFpy04ixBvrJ77kzQLqVwVT4ObZ_nzAgK80Hbth" alt="trunk" class="elle_trunk" style="width:20%">Elephants have poor eyesight but an<strong> amazing sense of smell.</strong> The elephant <strong>trunk has more than 40,000 muscles</strong> in it. Elephants waive their trunks up in the air and from side to side to smell better. The elephant's trunk is able to sense the size, shape and temperature of an object. African elephants have two fingerlike features on the end of their trunk that they can use to grab small items. Although the elephant trunk is really huge, weighing about 400 pounds, it is so dexterous it can pick up very tiny things including a single grain of rice.</p>

	   <p>Their <strong>tusks</strong> are of ivory and are actually enormously enlarged incisors. Elephants prefer one tusk over the other, just as people are either left or right-handed. They are used for defense, digging for water, and lifting things.</p>

	   <img src="http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/kids/photos/animals/Mammals/A-G/african-elephant-eating.jpg.adapt.945.1.jpg" alt="eat" class="elle_eat" style="width:20%">
	   <p>Elephants spend about <strong>16 hours a day eating</strong>. They consume as much as 300-600 pounds of food per day. Stories of African elephants getting drunk from the fermented fruit of the marula tree are not true, a study concluded. The animals don't eat the fruit off the ground where it ferments, the fresh fruit doesn't stay in the elephant's digestive tract long enough to ferment, and even if an elephant did eat the fermented fruit, it would take 1,400 pieces to get one drunk.</p>

	   <p>Elephants have a <strong>highly developed brain</strong> and the largest of all the land mammals. They are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory and they have cognitive maps to allow them to remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time.</p>

	   <p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTtyM40LnA3neRfGQ5SCqGs_GHySaboobu5pARsI4MJ2Zs675iFhg" alt="dust" class="elle_dust" style="width:25%">Elephant's <strong>skin</strong> is an inch thick and is so sensitive that they can feel a fly landing on it. Although tough, their skin <strong><em>is very sensitive</em></strong>. Elephants <strong><em>can also get sunburned</em></strong>, so they take care to protect themselves. They will throw sand on their backs and on their head. They do that to keep them from getting sunburned and to keep bugs off. To protect their young, adult elephants will douse them in sand and stand over the little ones as they sleep. Elephants use mud as a sunscreen, protecting their skin from ultraviolet light. Without the regular mud baths to protect it from burning, insect bites, and moisture loss, their skin suffers serious damage. Elephants do not have sweat glands either. Elephants have large, thin ears. Their ears are made up of a complex network of blood vessels which regulate an elephant's temperature. Blood is circulated through <strong>their ears</strong> to <strong>cool them down</strong> in hot climates.</p>

	   <p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS4j25HjKdAGraCM6qWbe9Fo7biDEBtY9_-Q6BGM1E4d_jnd5xwKw" alt="swim" class="elle_swim" style="width:20%">They love water and  <strong>like to swim</strong>, dive into the water and find great fun in fighting the waves. It also gives their joints a break with the buoyancy they get from the water. They use their trunk to breathe like a snorkel in deep water and are able to swim for long distances.</p>

	   <p>Only one mammal <strong>can't jump</strong> - the elephant. Elephant feet are covered in a soft padding that help uphold their weight, prevent them from slipping, and dull any sound. Therefore elephants can walk almost silently! Elephants normally walk about 4 mph.</p>

	   <p>Elephants purr like cats do, as a means of <strong>communication</strong>. They also use their feet to listen, they can pick up sub-sonic rumblings made by other elephants, through vibrations in the ground. Elephants are observed listening by putting trunks on the ground and carefully positioning their feet. An elephant is capable of hearing sound waves well below our human hearing limitation. An African elephant can detect seismic signals with sensory cells in its feet and also 'hear' these deep-pitched sounds when ground vibrations travel from the animal's front feet, up its leg and shoulder bones, and into its middle ear. By comparing the timing of signals received by each of its front feet, the elephant can determine the direction of the sound. Elephants produce several types of sounds. Perhaps the most well known is the trumpet, which is made during excitement, distress or aggression. They can hear one another's trumpeting up to 6 miles.</p>

	   <p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTx4GWHEbp8AckJHXFjkwV_rdnnaRY8jtQ77_DH6cCYiWzm9YRqyg" alt="herd" class="elle_herd" style="width:30%">Elephants are <strong>social creatures</strong>. They live in tight social units called herds led by a matriarch (oldest female in the group). They have greeting ceremonies when a friend that has been away for some time returns to the group. Touching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks in displays of greeting and affection. Elephants also have certain rules. For example, when they are meeting each other, they expect the other elephant to extend its trunk in greeting. The matriarch will often teach young elephants in her herd how to act properly. Older elephants also use trunk-slaps, kicks and shoves to discipline younger ones.</p>

	   <p>Male elephants (also called bulls) leave the matriarch groups between age 12 and 15. But they aren't loners, they live in all-male groups. In dry times, these males will form a linear hierarchy that helps them avoid injuries that could result from competing for water.</p>

	   <p>They are <strong>important for the environment</strong> because they pull down trees and break up thorny bushes, which help to create grasslands for other animals to survive. They dig waterholes in dry river beds that other animals can use as a water source, and their foot prints create deep holes that water can collect in. They create trails that act as fire breakers and water run offs. The nutrient-rich manure replenishes depleted soils so that humans can have a nutrient rich soil to plant crops in. Elephant Droppings are also a vehicle for seed dispersal. Some seeds will not germinate unless they have passed through an elephant's digestive system.</p>

	   <p>Elephants are <strong>not scared of mice</strong> as some myths suggest. However, they are <strong>scared of ants and bees</strong>. Consequently, farmers in some African countries protect their fields from elephants by lining the borders with beehives. Not only are their crops saved, but the farmers also get additional income from the honey.</p>

	     <h2>Poaching and Abuse Problem</h2>

	     <ul>
	       <li>One elephant is <strong>slaughtered every 15 muntes.</strong></li>
	       <li>Africa has lost <strong>90% of its elephant population</strong> in the last 50 years.</li>
	       <li>Fewer that <strong>400,000 remain in the wild.</strong></li>
	       <li>Profits from the sale of poached ivory are used <strong> to fund terorrist groups.</strong></li>
	       <li>The <strong>largest market for illegal ivory is China</strong>, where it is considered a status symbol.</li>
	       <li>Thousands of elephants are <strong>forced to perform</strong> under the threat of physical punishment (through <strong>use of bullhooks</strong> and pulling their ears).</li>
	       <li>Elephants that belong to circuses and zoos are <strong>kept chained or caged</strong> causing them to sway and <strong>suffer from tuberculosis</strong>.</li>
	       <li>They are <strong>separated from their families and friends</strong> (including baby elephants who need to be with their mothers) and sometimes living alone their whole life. </li>
	       <li>They are <strong>beaten into submission</strong> sufering physical injuries like getting blind or broken limbs, <strong>mental distress</strong> and even paying with their lives.</li>
	       <li>Many <strong>baby elephants are born in captivity</strong>. Ringling Bros. Circus retired all of  their elephants to a 'sanctuary' where they will still breed them, use bullhooks and do medical research on them.</li>
	       <li>All the elephants in Thailand that are used for riding, giving massages, paining pictures and posing for pictures have gone through 'training crush' cage where they go through process called <strong><a href="www.thailandelephants.org/the-ugly">The Phajaan - Breaking An Elephant's Spirit</a></strong> (warrning - disturbing images).</li>
	       </ul>

	       <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
	       <ul>
		 <li><strong>Don't go to the circus</strong> that uses animals!</li>
		 <li><strong>Don't go to zoos!</strong></li>
		 <li><strong>Don't fall into touristy traps</strong> that involve elephants or any other wildlife (including riding elephants as the most popular one).</li>
		 <li>Foster a baby elephant from <a href="www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/asp/fostering.asp">David Sheldrik Elephant Orphanage</a>.</li>
		 <li>Adopt an elephant from <a href="www.pawsweb.org/meet_elephants.html">PAWS (Performing Animal Welfare Society)</a>.</li>
		 <li><strong><em>Stay informed and spread awarness!!</em></strong></li>
		 </ul>

	       <p>There is <strong>other wildlife that is endagered</strong> or abused just as much as elephnats, to mention a few:</p>
	       <ul>
		 <li><strong>Rhinos</strong> - fewer that 25,000 remain in the wild, their poaching escalated 9,000% in last 9 years, one is murdered every 8 hours, the largest markets for illegal rhino horn are China and Vietnam, where it is mistakenly thought to have medicinal value. You can find out more <a href="https://www.savetherhino.org/get_involved/donate/ten_good_reasons_to_save_rhinos">here</a>.</li>
		 <li><strong>Bile Bears</strong> (Asiatic Black Bear and Sun Bear) - kept in captivity to harvest their bile (fluid produced by the liver and stored in gallbladder) in China, South Korea, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar; they are kept in cages so tight that they can't move (they can't sit, stand or turn around) because they have open wounds on their stomachs where they have apparatus attached that collects the bile. For more information click on the <a href="https://www.animalsasia.org/intl/media/news/news-archive/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-bear-bile-farming.html">link</a>. </li>
		 <li><strong>Pangolin</strong> - most trafficked mammal, they are considered delicacy in China, Vietnam and other parts of south-east Asia, their scales are prized for traditional medicine. You can read more about them <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/pangolins-what-are-they-why-are-they-so-endangered-and-what-can-we-do-to-help-10085887.html">here</a>.</li>
